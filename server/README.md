DOCUMENTATION: 

-About the app: LimoTech is an app to help transportation companies manage their fleet, and keep their fleet in check so they're always aware of the wear and tear on their cars. By providing them with the type of car, the official car name, the year of the model, as well as the mileage on it and the driver info, owners can have a general idea of how old or new their cars are, and when its high time to renew them or add more to their fleet.

-In order to run the app locally, you want to run "npm init -y" and then "npm i express express-validator pug body-parser nodemon" to install the correct packages. Then, type "npm start" still in terminal, and now at "http://localhost:3000/" you can see the web application.

-The application dependencies of this application include, but are not limited to, bootstrap, all the packages installed for the node.js bit, and numerous other libraries references in head.pug.
